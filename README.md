# Execution Plan
I will do Uber Analysis. My execution plan is: 

Week 4: Understanding the Business Model
    - I’ll dive deep into understanding Uber’s business model and pinpoint the challenges that can be tackled with data analytics.
    - I’ll also familiarize myself with Uber’s Machine Learning Model and Dynamic Pricing Model.
Week 5: Data Collection and Preprocessing
    - I’ll gather all the necessary data for my analysis, which might include details about Uber pickups, ride durations, distances, and pricing.
    - I’ll then preprocess this data to make it ready for analysis, which might involve cleaning up the data, handling missing values, and possibly extracting features.
Week 6: Exploratory Data Analysis
    - I’ll conduct an exploratory data analysis on the data I’ve collected. This will help me understand the distribution of data, spot any outliers, and comprehend the relationships between different data points.
Week 7: Predictive Modelling
    - I’ll start constructing a predictive model using the preprocessed data. This will involve selecting a suitable machine learning algorithm, training the model, and fine-tuning it for optimal performance.
Week 8: Evaluation and Iteration
    - I’ll evaluate the predictive model’s performance using various metrics to see how well it’s doing.
    - Based on this evaluation, I’ll refine the model to enhance its performance. This might involve adjusting the model parameters, trying out different algorithms, or revisiting the data preprocessing stage to engineer new features.
